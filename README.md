`dsmexplorer` - explore your density surface models
===================================================

Series of `shiny` apps to explore model results from density surface models (fitted using the [`dsm`](http://github.com/distancedevelopment/dsm) package).

Currently experimental, using only the [Gulf of Mexico pantropical dolphin data](https://github.com/dill/mexico-data).

Explorations:

- `shiny_prediction_explorer.R` explore a map of predictions and see where they lie on smooths
- `shiny_resid_explorer.R` investigate deviance residual quantile-quantile plot
